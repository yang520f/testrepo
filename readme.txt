this is fist git repo
this is a test
this file was frist changed
I add a newline
this is my second test for change the file and add+commit
git has a special stage
to test the if not add to staged index and commit if not the changed thing will be save
I add a info and this info has't be add to staged index. now I commit a version
create a new line in branch dev;
delete and creat a new dev;
creating a new branch is quich and simple;
